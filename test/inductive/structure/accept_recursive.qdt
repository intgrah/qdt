structure Stream (A : Type) where

example : (A : Type) → A → Stream A → Stream A := Stream.mk
example : (A : Type) → Stream A → A := Stream.head
example : (A : Type) → Stream A → Stream A := Stream.tail

example :

    ((head : A) → (tail : Stream A) → motive tail → motive (Stream.mk A head tail)) →
